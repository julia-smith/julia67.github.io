  <p>The <a href="https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/">Knight-Mozilla fellowship</a> is super awesome. If you've ever wanted to work in a newsroom, build cool things, and travel a lot – <a href="https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/apply/">you should apply</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm more than halfway through my fellowship now, and it’s neat to look back at all the things I’ve been able to do: I've worked on news apps, spoken at conferences, learned tons of new skills, participated in hackathons, traveled a bit… It’s been a fantastic experience so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://livialabate.com/says/so-you-think-you-can-dance/">Livia</a>, <a href="http://spaceandtim.es/opennews/fellowship_status">Francis</a>, <a href="http://blog.kavyasukumar.com/paging-developers-to-newsrooms/">Kavya</a>, and <a href="http://www.juanelosua.com/posts/fellowship/fellowship-midpoint/">Juan</a> already shared their notes on life as a fellow, and I’ve been keeping track of my fellowship with monthly checkins: <a href="../the-first-month/">The First Month</a>, <a href="../the-second-month/">The Second Month</a>, <a href="../the-third-month/">The Third Month</a>, <a href="../the-fourth-month/">The Fourth Month</a>, <a href="../the-fifth-month/">The Fifth Month</a>. </p>

<p>There's just one other thing I'd like to add. </p>

<p>In my experience, <strong>the most enjoyable, valuable aspect of the fellowship is simply the exposure to the rest of the journalism-developer community</strong> – the "news nerds," as they're sometimes called. These are folks who care deeply about journalism and technology, and there's a lot of crossover with other areas like open source, data science, design, civic tech, etc. This community is active and welcoming. Coming from the outside, it was surprising how immediately I identified with it.</p>

<p>I wasn't involved with OpenNews or the broader network before the fellowship started; in fact, I was barely aware it existed. I was very settled in Omaha – my hometown, which is notably <em>not coastal</em> – and although I was designing things, working with data, and writing code every day for work, I had never contributed to a real open source project. I had participated in a single civic hackathon, and it had been years since I had freelanced as a print designer for the local newspaper. <strong>I was dancing around the edge of news nerdery</strong>, but hadn't had the full introduction or the right opportunity to dive in. </p>

<p>Then <a href="../cool-fellowships-at-cool-places/">I learned about the fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>But enough with the backstory. </p>

<p>The point is: <strong>The <a href="https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/">Knight-Mozilla fellowship</a> introduced me to this vibrant, friendly, and intellectually engaging group of people.</strong> Working in a major newsroom gives you the opportunity to connect with your coworkers – who are connected to their colleagues at various global organizations – and suddenly you're in an extended network of people who all care about journalism and tech. You also become part of a growing group of Knight-Mozilla alumni, which is a network in itself. </p>

<p>Additionally, the fellowship provides opportunities to interact with the extended community remotely via the <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/calls/">OpenNews community calls</a>, the <a href="https://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/">NICAR listserv</a>, and Twitter. It also provides the means to meet and collaborate in-person at <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/convenings/">code convenings</a>, meetups, hack days, and conferences <em>around the world</em>. (Frequent travel is another fun new thing for me.)</p>

<p><br><img src="../content/images/2015/08/badges.jpg" alt="" title=""><span class="caption">And that's just five months' worth.</span></p>

<p>And meeting people at conferences is especially great because it's super easy to stay in touch with everyone afterwards – the expanded network is invaluable. It's awesome that you can travel to a city where you previously didn't know anyone, and now you can reach out to a new connection and either meet up or get suggestions for places to visit. And I realize this is an obvious sequence of events for many – but I <em>never</em>  would've been comfortable doing that prior to this fellowship, and that speaks to the <strong>level of accessibility this community offers</strong>.</p>

<p>You know what's even better? <strong>We're here for you, too.</strong> Follow people <a href="http://twitter.com/julia67">on Twitter</a>. Join a <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/calls/">community call</a>. <strong><a href="https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/apply/">Apply for a fellowship</a></strong>. If you're even tangentially interested in journalism and the open web, you're a news nerd already. </p>

<p>This is for you. </p>
