            <p>Month No. 4 was busy...and pretty awesome.</p>

<p>I had a few graphics published on <a href="http://revealnews.org/">revealnews.org</a>. I attended a couple great conferences. I mentored some people. Another one of my session proposals was accepted. <em>AND</em> I started building some actual tools that (I hope) will be useful for CIR and the rest of the data journalism community. </p>

<p>Fun stuff.</p>

<h4 id="publishedwherecanyoucarryaconcealedguninpublic">Published: Where can you carry a concealed gun in public?</h4>

<p><em>This was <a href="../the-third-month/index.html#supersecretprojectno2">Super-Secret Project No. 2</a> that I mentioned last month.</em></p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/06/us-map.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Project strengths:</strong>
I’m pretty happy with how this project turned out, especially from the technical implementation side of things. It’s quite small for an interactive (~157KB, almost half of which comes from Reveal web fonts and analytics); it’s responsive; it provides a tailored experience for touch devices; and the data is completely accessible via the keyboard <em>and</em> screen readers. I think it’s a good stab at making interactive graphics usable for a broader audience. </p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for improvement:</strong>
I don’t love this interactive from a news value perspective – it's a bit superficial since most of the data isn’t geographic. Also, the addition of the court locations was a (very) late feature request, so that portion of the graphic doesn't work particularly well on mobile devices, just due to time constraints. There's definitely room to improve the newsroom's digital workflow processes; I have some ideas that I'll elaborate on at a later date.</p>

<h4 id="publishedcaliforniasconcealedgunpermitsbycounty">Published: California's Concealed Gun Permits by County</h4>

<p><em>These interactives were part of <a href="../the-third-month/index.html#supersecretprojectno3">Super-Secret Project No. 3</a> I mentioned last month.</em></p>

<p><strong>Project strengths:</strong>
The graphics are lightweight and performant; the data is (mostly) accessible; the styles are on-brand; and the user experience on mobile isn't terrible. I also wrote all the interactivity in vanilla javascript, so the graphics are depedency-free, which is nice.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for improvement:</strong>
Deadlines: They're important, they only work when they're communicated, and theoretically they shouldn't move – they especially shouldn't move <em>up</em>. For these graphics, I had a bunch of accessibility enhancements I hoped to get in place before publication, but when (on June 11) the deadline moved from Tuesday, June 16 to Friday, June 12...certain features were cut. So now I'm trying to build some SVG generation tools that will automatically include accessiblility features (tab indexes, keyboard events, etc.) so that developers no longer need to budget time to add AT enhancements to small graphics like these.</p>

<h4 id="awaitingpublicationsupersecretprojectno1">Awaiting Publication: Super-Secret Project No. 1</h4>

<p><em>This is the same project (<a href="../the-third-month/index.html#supersecretprojectno1">Super-Secret Project No. 1</a>) that I talked about last month. I finished it around mid-May, but I'm not sure when it's scheduled for publication.</em></p>

<h4 id="newprojectaccessiblesvggenerator">New Project: Accessible SVG Generator</h4>

<p>Like I mentioned above, I'm working on a front-end tool that will generate accessible SVG graphics. It's going to be more of a resource for UI folks and ambitious reporters rather than back-end devs. I'm excited about it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<p>My session proposal on SVG animation was accepted for <a href="https://nejsconf.com/">NEJSConf</a>. It's a single-track conference, so that'll be a new and exciting experience for me. This conference is also going to be awesome because: </p>

<ol>
<li>It's at the <a href="http://www.omahazoo.com/">zoo</a>.  </li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/beep">@beep</a> is the keynote.</li>
<li>I get to return to Homaha for it. </li>
</ol>

<p>These are all good things.</p>
