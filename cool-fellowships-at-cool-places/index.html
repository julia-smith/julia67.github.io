        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Last August, I was sharing a bottle of wine with the amazing <a href="http://jmac.creighton.edu/?page_id=234" target="_blank">Dr. Carol Zuegner</a>, my friend and former j-school advisor, as we discussed how my newish job was going. I was working as a web developer for a <a href="http://oxidedesign.com/" target="_blank">small graphic design studio</a> and was feeling mostly content but somewhat underwhelmed with the work. And Carol, in all her wisdom, reminded me that I have “a very particular set of skills” …</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/03/taken.jpg" alt="Liam Neeson in 'Taken'">
<span class="caption">Not those kinds of skills.</span></p>

<p>…that news organizations are hungrily seeking. She asked if I'd considered applying for opportunities outside of Omaha – perhaps grad school, perhaps something else.</p>

<p>I didn’t put a ton of consideration into the suggestion – I was living quite the comfortable life in Omaha and was hesitant to disrupt it. I had also been working outside the news industry for the last three or four years and wasn't sure if my journalism degree was still relevant.</p>

<p>The next day, Carol sent me an email entitled “cool fellowships at cool places,” containing a link to the <a href="http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/" target="_blank">Knight-Mozilla fellowship</a> program. It was surprising how perfect it sounded. From a skills and interests perspective, it seemed like a tailor-made opportunity. And, incredibly, it included a reasonable stipend and time commitment. </p>

<p>I had two days to apply. </p>

<p>NBD.</p>

<p>I drafted my responses to the application fairly quickly but spent most of those two days reading blog posts about the fellowship experience. Notable reading material included:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/94827905007/opennews-t-minus-36-hours" target="_blank">This one</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/@veltman%20target=" _blank>@veltman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/56132893301/code-the-newsroom-and-self-doubt" target="_blank">This one</a> also via <a href="http://twitter.com/@veltman%20target=" _blank>@veltman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://erikaowens.com/blog/who-should-apply-knight-mozilla-fellowship-you" target="_blank">This one</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/@erika_owens" target="_blank">@erika_owens</a></li>
<li><a href="http://briantjacobs.com/john-cusack-on-becoming-a-2015-knight-mozilla-fellow/" target="_blank">This one</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/@btjakes%20target=" _blank>@btjakes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided this was actually something I really really really wanted to do.</p>

<p>A few hours before the deadline (not a record, BTW), I hit the submit button and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>The waiting game began. I cycled between ultra-confidence and crippling self-doubt on a near-daily basis as I anticipated a response from OpenNews. When I was feeling level-headed, I estimated I would make it into the group of semifinalists but probably not any further than that. When I made it past that point, I had no more expectations. </p>

<p>The two months leading up to the final fellowship decision felt like this:</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/03/positivity-chart-1.jpg" alt="Chart: Positivity over Time">
<span class="caption">I'm just trying to have fun here.</span></p>

<p>Here's a timeline of some tweet-sized feels:</p>

<p><span class="callout"><strong>Aug. 14</strong> <br>Beginning to read about the fellowship. Very excited.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Aug. 16</strong> <br>Application submitted. Feeling super confident because I thought my application materials turned out awesome.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Sept. 5</strong> <br>Semifinalist notification. Happy but trying to stay realistic.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Sept. 10</strong> <br>Prepping for first interview. Feeling confident; I usually interview pretty well.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Sept. 11</strong> <br>Interviewed with OpenNews. Thought it went horribly. Had too much coffee and felt like I couldn’t keep my thoughts straight.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Sept. 19</strong> <br>Finalist notification. Very pleasantly surprised. </span><span class="callout"><strong>Sept. 25</strong> <br>Interview with CIR. Feeling pretty good about it.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Oct. 1</strong> <br>Still feeling good. Blind hope is balancing any lack of confidence. Should receive a final decision tomorrow.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Oct. 2</strong> <br>A day full of anxious excitement and anticipation. I am very jumpy.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Oct. 3</strong> <br>Received news that a decision hasn’t been made yet. I'm convinced the fellowship was offered to another. Sad. Reevaluating all life decisions.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Oct. 6</strong> <br>Received another email. Still no news. At least this isn’t a rejection. I'm still in the running. Feeling slightly better.</span><span class="callout"><strong>Oct. 10</strong> <br>Oh happy day! 2015 Knight-Mozilla fellow at the Center for Investigative Reporting. So excite!!</span></p>

<p>And that's the brief overview of my experience with the fellowship selection process. </p>

<p>One other thing to note – one reason my pre-semifinalist positivity remained high – is that I kept a close eye on the Google Analytics report for my personal website. I received very little traffic prior to applying for the fellowship, and visits to my site were almost entirely from Nebraska. After I applied, I started getting hits from other locations – New York, Chicago, D.C., London – places that definitely had a host news organization or other OpenNews presence. Occassionally, the ISP even said something super informative, like "National Public Radio." So I had a nice quantitative measure that my application likely made it past the first round of cuts, which took some of the edge off. </p>

<p>Gotta love data.</p>
