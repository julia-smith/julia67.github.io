<h2 id="events">Events</h2>

<h6 id="techrakingelevatingthenews">TechRaking: Elevating the News</h6>

<p>CIR hosted a <a href="http://www.revealnews.org/events/techraking/techraking-elevating-the-news/">drone journalism event</a> in Berkeley on April 22. The day started with a panel discussion on advancements in drone technology and legislative issues, and in the afternoon everyone broke into teams to develop proposals for projects that would utilize drone technology for journalistic efforts. </p>

<p>My team presented the winning concept for DroneHound, which would use drones to collect air samples in highly polluted areas and report the data with a mobile app. </p>

<h6 id="smashingconf2015">SmashingConf 2015</h6>

<p>I went to Santa Monica at the tail end of April for <a href="http://smashingconf.com/la-2015/">SmashingConf</a>, one of Smashing Magazine's annual conferences. </p>

<p><a href="../smashingconf-notes/">I took a lot of notes</a>. </p>

<p>I thought all the talks were really engaging, which can be tricky for multi-day, single-track conferences. (That's a lot of sitting and listening.) <a href="http://twitter.com/draplin">Aaron Draplin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/andybudd">Andy Budd's</a> talks were probably my favorites. </p>

<p>I very much enjoyed being at a design event – I think sometimes the official news nerd conferences can be a little overwhelming because there are so many areas of concentration (reporting, data, coding, design, etc.), so sometimes it's nice to focus intently on one discipline.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<h6 id="supersecretprojectno1">Super-Secret Project No. 1</h6>

<p>This is the same project I started working on last month, and hopefully it will be done soon. It's been a real struggle from a process perspective (project management, expectations, communication, etc.) – which makes me wonder if there are things we can do to make the design process smoother going forward. I have plenty of suggestions, I'm just not sure of the best way to incorporate them into the editorial process, nor do I expect they'd be received well. I need to bounce ideas off others in the newsroom.</p>

<h6 id="supersecretprojectno2">Super-Secret Project No. 2</h6>

<p>It's a map! Nothing fancy, but it was nice to have a quick project to build. I believe it'll be published in early June.</p>

<h6 id="supersecretprojectno3">Super-Secret Project No. 3</h6>

<p>It's a map! This one is slightly more involved than the last. It's also set for publication in early June. </p>

<p>Perhaps next month I'll be able to share more details and the GitHub repos for all these. It's a little strange trying to work in the open when I'm not obliged to discuss unpublished projects.</p>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<h6 id="srccon">SRCCON</h6>

<p>One of my <a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON</a> session proposals was accepted, which is great. I'll be leading a discussion on <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/#proposal-112035">Lo-Fi Data Viz</a> along with <a href="http://twitter.com/aboutaaron">Aaron Williams</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zhoyoyo">Youyou Zhou</a>.  </p>

<h6 id="newsroomupdate">Newsroom Update</h6>

<p>We just found out that Aaron is leaving CIR, which is sad for us! I expect my role will evolve a bit as a result.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey! Some personal news. I'll be joining the <a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle">@sfchronicle</a> as its data visualization editor starting in June. Ain't that something?</p>— Aaron Williams (@aboutaaron) <a href="https://twitter.com/aboutaaron/status/600431407735787520">May 18, 2015</a></blockquote>
